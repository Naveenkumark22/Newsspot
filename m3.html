    When Joseph Robinette Biden Jr is sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021, he will be 78 years of age, already the oldest ever leader to hold that office. He will also have the distinction of winning the highest number of popular votes in the US presidential elections, ahead of even Barack Obama. Not bad for a former vice-president who was regarded as a has-been till he overtook the Democratic party’s frontrunners in the primaries to win the nomination. He then went on to win the presidency, defeating incumbent Donald Trump who had scornfully dismissed him as ‘Sleepy Joe’.
<br><br>
On the flip side, Biden will be leading a country that is deeply divided and polarised by the vote itself, and along more enduring fault-lines of race, class and geography. This at a time when the global Covid-19 pandemic has hit America the hardest with 9.5 million cases and 234,000 deaths as of November 5. It has already severely diminished the country’s economy, rendering over 20 million people jobless, a catastrophe that invites comparison with the Great Depression. Worse, Trump’s boast to ‘Make America Great Again’ has been reduced to ‘America Alone’. He quarrelled with America’s trusted allies, broke away from treaties and agreements, declined to be the global super-cop and conducted disruptive, tweet-driven diplomacy that has considerably undermined the status and stature of the world’s premier power. And all this while the coronavirus crisis has accelerated the process of de-globalisation the world over, increasing isolation and eroding individual liberties and freedoms.

So, Biden’s task for the next four years is pretty much cut out. But is he up to it? And what does his presidency mean for India and the world?
<br><br>
Saving Home
<br><br>
The answers to these questions lie in the forces that propelled Biden to the presidency. Before the elections, America faced what experts called the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: the pandemic and the physical toll it took on Americans, the steep economic downturn it caused, the deep racial divisions triggered by heavy-handed and often bigoted policing, and the growing sense of social injustice felt across the country. If Biden finally won the US election, it was not because people totally rejected Trump’s policies, as the president did win a high percentage of the popular vote. The nation embraced Biden because he seemed to have a better plan to pull the nation out of its health and economic woes and was regarded as more of a unifying force than Trump to heal some of the deep wounds across the country.
<br><br>Biden, despite his penchant for and expertise on foreign policy, is likely to spend most of his tenure focusing on solving critical domestic issues. How strong a president he will make may be determined by whether the Democrats can wrest control of the Senate from the Republicans and retain control of the House of Representatives. If the Republicans retain control of the Senate, it will considerably cramp Biden’s style and speed of decision-making. That’s because this important wing of the Congress confirms key appointments, including the president’s cabinet secretaries and judges of the Supreme Court, apart from ratifying bills and approving treaties. Biden’s advantage is that he has been senator for 36 years and has good rapport across the aisles as well as a reputation for securing bipartisan support on key issues.
<br><br>
Biden is also seen as more of a restorer than a reformer or transformer. Michael Krepon, co-founder of the Stimson Center, who had interacted with him when he held office, describes him as “a decent human being, more of a kind uncle rather than a bright shiny object. We know about him, what his limitations are and that he will try his best to do the job”. A former Senate foreign relations committee chairman, Biden impressed most wonks with his prescience on key international issues confronting the US. As vice-president, he had pushed for a lighter footprint strategy in Afghanistan. Sameer Lalwani, Krepon’s colleague at Stimson, says, “Those involved spoke highly of Biden’s decision-making ability and strategic grasp of the big picture. They said it was not just instinctive but came from his deep study of a problem. His dispassionate assessment and his courage to pursue counter-conventional wisdom made him an effective leader.
<br><br>



Now, Biden will have to bring these skills to bear on the crucial domestic issues his country faces. On top of the list is containing the third wave of the pandemic. Unlike Trump, Biden is a passionate advocate of wearing masks and social distancing measures. There are concerns, though, that he may resort to frequent lockdowns to curtail its spread and hurt the economy. To provide better health facilities, Biden is likely to restore the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, which Trump negated while failing to provide an alternative. Biden’s plan is to give the elderly better healthcare at lower cost, a move that won him support across an ageing nation where a third of the population is above 60 years of age.
<br><br>
For the economy, Biden will focus heavily on improving the state of America’s burgeoning middle class, which has emerged as the backbone of the country and is now considered his main support base. Unlike Trump, who favoured a fossil fuel-driven revival of the economy, Biden has boldly pushed for clean technology and promises an energy revolution that will create 10 million jobs, including a massive expansion in infrastructure. For boosting the manufacturing sector, the president-elect is championing a ‘Buy American’ programme (which sounds suspiciously like Trump’s ‘America First’) that calls for $400 billion worth of government purchases of US manufactured goods and services and an additional $300 billion to fund new research and development in key technology areas.
<br><br>
To fund his promised $700 billion expansion plans for the economy, Biden plans to raise taxes on the super-rich apart from corporate houses. To win over the big constituency of Left-leaning Democrats, Biden has also committed to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Republican-controlled Senate refused to consider voting on such a bill passed by the House of Representatives last year, citing the higher costs it would impose on business. Biden also plans to strengthen labour-friendly laws. Both proposals are designed to attract the votes of the vast band of supporters of Bernie Sanders, a leader of the Democrats’ far left, whom he defeated in the primaries.
