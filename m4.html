    As a private chat forum, WhatsApp has no equal, not in India, not in the world. Globally, the American freeware, cross-platform messaging service, owned by Facebook, boasts 2 billion users across 180 countries. With an estimated 65 billion messages being transmitted daily apart from 2 billion minutes of voice and video calls being made every day in 2018, it is undoubtedly the world’s most popular messaging service. In India, its user base of 400 million makes the country WhatsApp’s largest market. Besides being free, WhatsApp is simple to use, allows one to send text, audio and video messages and documents. But, most of all, it promises privacy and secrecy of communication, assuring every user that “messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of this chat, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them”.
<br><br>
This reputation of confidentiality that the messaging service enjoyed has now come under a cloud in India. Serious concerns are being raised about WhatsApp’s ability to protect a person’s privacy apart from preventing content from being transmitted and stored on its service from unauthorised access and misuse. Ironically, the erosion of trust began with a series of unrelated recent incidents. It started when Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput died in Mumbai on June 14 under mysterious circumstances. Agencies investigating Sushant’s death began to selectively leak WhatsApp conversations to media initially to debunk claims by suspects, including Sushant’s ex-girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty. In one instance, Chakraborty’s conversations with filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt were used to show that she left Rajput and not he who asked her to leave.
<br><br>
Later, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which began investigating a drug angle in the death, used her alleged chat with a drug peddler to arrest her. As the NCB expanded its investigation scope, WhatsApp conversations of top actors such as Deepika Padukone were released in the public realm, feeding the impression that drug abuse is rampant in the Mumbai film industry. Earlier, on September 16, the Delhi Police filed a charge-sheet in a special court against 15 people alleging that they created WhatsApp groups in December 2019 to organise the riots that broke out in the national Capital in February. Once again, chat transcripts of these groups were selectively leaked to the media.
<br><br>

The alarming rate at which law enforcement agencies are accessing and using WhatsApp chats as incriminating evidence is increasingly making users wary of the security and privacy apparatus of this most widely-used messenger platform in the world. The impunity with which media houses publicly air these chats, infringing on privacy that the Supreme Court has declared a fundamental right, has once again fuelled demand for the immediate passage of an effective and comprehensive law dealing with data protection and privacy. 
<br><br>
Most cyber experts agree that the interception of these encrypted messages during transmission is near-impossible. “It is not easy to decrypt encrypted messages. What enforcement agencies are passing off as decrypting messages is more a case of recovering the backup on the user’s phone, and accessing the messages,” says Jaijit Bhattacharya, president, Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research. In fact, this end-to-end encryption is why WhatsApp has often expressed helplessness to law enforcement agencies about fake news and hate messages transmitted via the app, as it has no way of knowing what is being sent or received. Indian government has been pressing for traceability of WhatsApp messages to check the spread of fake news but the chat platform has declined to comply with such requests till now saying that it undermines the privacy of the people. Many observers fear that traceability of the source of a message could be misused for snooping for political purposes and it could be a matter of time before WhatsApp starts cooperating with government agencies, at least unofficially, given that India is also the largest market of its parent body Facebook with around 350 million users and nearly Rs 900 crore business annually. In December 2018, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology proposed changes to Section 79 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 making it mandatory for such platforms to enable tracing out of originators of information when demanded by legally authorised government agencies.

While traceability is beyond law now, what these message services are silent on are the areas your chats are vulnerable in. All electronic messages transmitted from one phone to another are stored in four places from where data can be retrieved later, the phone memory of the sender as well as of the receiver, the server of the service provider, be it WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal or iMessage, and on the cloud, should the user have allowed it in his settings. Besides, messages are not encrypted in storage, which means anyone with access to the sender/ receiver’s phones can read those messages.

Hackers and even government agencies are alleged to be using spyware to spy on targeted phones where decrypted messages can be read live or even retrieved. Several WhatsApp accounts were hacked worldwide by the Pegasus remote surveillance software made by Israel-based cyber tech firm, NSO. The most famous instance was in 2018, when Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, had his mobile phone hacked after receiving a WhatsApp message purportedly sent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. “Once a hacker accesses a phone, either through physical possession or through hacking, he or she can virtually collect all the data inside the phone,” says cybersecurity expert Subimal Bhattacharjee.

It’s equally easy to hack into the cloud backup of such messages. In the case of WhatsApp, if the user activates the backup option, the message gets stored in Google Drive or iCloud. One then only has to uninstal and re-instal WhatsApp on the same phone or another using the same SIM card to retrieve the back-up on Google Drive or iCloud.
<br><br>

Most chat platforms claim they don’t store private messages of users on their servers. “WhatsApp does not store private messages on its servers once they’re delivered. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (say, if a person is offline), it may be kept on WhatsApp servers for up to 30 days as it tries to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, it is deleted,” explains a WhatsApp spokesperson.
<br><br>
In this respect, WhatsApp and Signal score over Telegram, which doesn’t have end-to-end encryption as its default setting. Only if the user exercises the “Secret Chat” option are messages transmitted through end-to-end encryption in Telegram. Even so, the choice is not available for group chat. When Secret Chat is not activated, the messages travel encrypted from the sender’s device but get decrypted on Telegram’s server, which means messages can be read. Again, the messages are encrypted on the server and sent to the recipient’s device, where they are finally decrypted. So, if someone succeeds in hacking into Telegram’s server, they can access users’ private messages. In theory, law enforcement agencies can also access data stored on Telegram servers with an official request, though the Dubai-based platform is known for not being cooperative with authorities.
<br><<br>
Even platforms that don’t store messages on their servers can help in different ways. “It’s not just the conversation,” says a scientist in the Cyber Laws Group of the IT and electronics ministry. “These platforms can help probe agencies with other information such as metadata, which can be crucial in finding leads and busting crimes.” Metadata refers to the log of chats and phone calls between different users, timestamps on messages, IP addresses, geolocation, details of contacts, etc. While metadata does not allow anyone to read the messages, it gives information on whom and when a user messaged or called and how long. Platforms such as Signal store minimal metadata and are becoming popular among people concerned about their privacy or committed to it on principle.
